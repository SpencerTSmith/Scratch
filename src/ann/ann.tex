\section{Design Choices Made by the Assignment}

The following choices were made by the assignment specification:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Learning paradigm:} Supervised learning, as labeled class data is provided.
    \item \textbf{Task type:} Binary classification — each sample belongs to one of two classes.
    \item \textbf{Architecture type:} Feedforward neural network with error backpropagation.
    \item \textbf{Loss signal:} Classification error between predicted and true class label.
    \item \textbf{Datasets:} Nine fixed datasets across Gaussian 2D, Gaussian 3D, and crescent moon distributions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Choices Made by Us}

The following choices were made during implementation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hidden layers:} One hidden layer, as the universal approximation theorem guarantees a single hidden layer is sufficient to approximate any continuous function given enough neurons.
    \item \textbf{Hidden neurons:} 32 neurons per hidden layer.
    \item \textbf{Activation function:} Sigmoid, $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$, chosen for its smooth gradient and natural probabilistic interpretation for binary classification. Also simple derivative.
    \item \textbf{Learning rate:} $\eta = 0.1$
    \item \textbf{Weight initialization:} Uniform random in $[-1, 1]$.
\end{itemize}
